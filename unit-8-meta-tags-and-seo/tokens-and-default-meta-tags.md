# Tokens and default meta tags

## What is a token

A _token_ is a formatted chunks of text that serves as a placeholder for a dynamically generated value. For example \[site:name\] serves as a placeholder for a site's name.

The search result screenshot above outlines “tokens” that are automatically replaced by GovCMS when content is created or updated. The tokens in use are:

1. \[node:title\] - title of the page, taken from the page's _Title_ field.
2. \[site:name\] - the name of the site \(GovCMS in this case\).
3. \[node:summary\] - an automatically generated summary of the page contents. This can be edited by clicking on the **Edit summary** link above the _Body_ field of a page.
